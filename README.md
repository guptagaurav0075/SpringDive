# SpringDive

SpringDive repository is the first dive to learn Spring framework. Currently I'm learning the framework from Webapp: https://javabrains.io/courses/spring_core/lessons/ApplicationContext-and-Property-Initialization/.
 The project is trying to replicate the examples from the webapp shared with some modifications for the example shared.
